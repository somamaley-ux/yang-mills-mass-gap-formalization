Paper-facing support statement for
"Unitary Mixing Saturation under Admissible Transport".

This is the minimal faithful Lean surface for the current repo: it certifies the
saturation logic and the no-residual-mixing consequence without pretending that
the full operator-diagonalization algebra has already been formalized here.
