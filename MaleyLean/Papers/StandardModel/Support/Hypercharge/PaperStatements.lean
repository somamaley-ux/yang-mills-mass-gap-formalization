Paper-facing support statement for
"Hypercharge Normalization and Electric Charge Quantization under Admissible
Redescription".

This is the minimal faithful Lean surface for the current repo: it certifies the
equivalence logic and the no-split consequence without pretending that the full
hypercharge-assignment algebra has already been formalized here.
