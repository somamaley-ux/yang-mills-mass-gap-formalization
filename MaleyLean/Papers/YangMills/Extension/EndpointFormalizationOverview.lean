Overview of the Yang--Mills endpoint-extension formalization spine.

This module is intentionally light-weight: it re-exports the extension stack and
records the intended dependency order of the theorem surfaces formalized for the
nonlocal endpoint manuscript.

The progression is:

1. `EndpointAdmissibilityFormalization`
   recalls the predecessor Yang--Mills proof-home surfaces and introduces the
   abstract theorem-scope sector bridge.
2. `VacuumGapConcreteUpstreamSideConditions`
   packages the concrete QE3 / vacuum-gap transport, reconstruction, and
   realization witnesses already carried by the closed manuscript object into a
   reusable shared upstream statement.
3. `VacuumGapConcreteManuscriptProjection`
   projects that concrete QE3 package onto the manuscript-facing Part D /
   Route 1 theorem-content surface, so the shared upstream witness package
   already feeds the paper-facing QE3 theorem API.
4. `VacuumGapConcreteCriticalSeam`
   isolates the concrete QE3 kill-switch cluster from the closed manuscript
   object itself: continuous-time upgrade, density export, graph-core handoff,
   continuum transport, and the sharp-local gap conclusion.
5. `VacuumGapConcreteSeamFactors`
   splits that QE3 cluster into two narrower theorem surfaces: density plus
   graph-core handoff, and continuum transport plus sharp-local gap.
   It now also makes the public QE3 critical-seam/minimal-payload interface
   reconstruction-explicit on the closed manuscript, Part D, and shared
   side-condition surfaces: the live recoveries of each are shown to agree
   directly with the proofs rebuilt from the other.
6. `VacuumGapConcreteProofHomeProjection`
   connects the native proof-home and mass-gap-chain witness layers back into
   the reduced QE3 seam payload and recovers the full concrete QE3 critical
   seam from those upstream certificates. It now also records explicitly that,
   at the current theorem surface, the reduced density/graph payload and full
   density/graph seam recovered from the native proof-home layer are exact
   source-level equivalents of the manuscript-facing density/graph seam
   surfaces. The native-proof-home recovery of the full density/graph seam is
   now also shown to agree directly with the proof rebuilt from that same
   source route's own reduced density/graph payload. The mass-gap-chain
   transport/gap route is now reconstruction-explicit as well: both its
   reduced transport/gap payload and its full transport/gap factor are shown
   to agree directly with the proofs rebuilt from that same route's own lower
   transport/gap ingredients. The native-proof-home density/graph route is now
   reconstruction-explicit at the reduced-payload level too: its reduced
   density/graph payload is now shown to agree directly with the proof rebuilt
   from that same route's own lower density/graph ingredients.
7. `VacuumGapConcreteChosenSiteBridgeProjection`
   shows that the chosen-site bridge layer already carries the reduced
   density/graph payload and recovers the concrete density/graph factor from
   that bridge. It now also records explicitly that, at the current theorem
   surface, the reduced density/graph payload and full density/graph seam
   recovered from the chosen-site bridge are exact source-level equivalents of
   the manuscript-facing density/graph seam surfaces. It now also records
   directly that the native-proof-home and chosen-site source routes agree
   exactly with one another at both the reduced-payload and full-seam levels,
   and that the corresponding reduced-payload and full-seam source recoveries
   now agree by direct proof equality as well. The chosen-site-bridge recovery
   of the full density/graph seam is now also shown to agree directly with the
   proof rebuilt from that same source route's own reduced density/graph
   payload. Its reduced density/graph payload is now likewise shown to agree
   directly with the proof rebuilt from that same route's own lower
   density/graph ingredients.
8. `VacuumGapConcreteRoute1EndpointProjection`
   shows that the concrete Route 1 to endpoint native package already carries
   the reduced transport/gap payload, the endpoint-boundary statement, and the
   bundled second-seam theorem surface built from them, and that the canonical
   closed-manuscript paper-flow surface already exposes the same manuscript-
   shaped second seam. It now also states explicitly that the first and second
   QE3 kill-switch seams together recover the current QE3 minimal payload and
   hence the full manuscript-facing QE3 critical seam, and moreover that this
   joint two-seam synthesis is logically equivalent to both the current QE3
   minimal payload and the current QE3 critical seam. The Route 1 endpoint
   package's own endpoint-boundary recovery, smaller second-seam recovery, and
   paper-shaped second-seam recovery are now also shown to agree directly with
   the proofs rebuilt from their own lower source ingredients. The same Route 1
   endpoint-package route is now also reconstruction-explicit already at the
   transport/gap layer itself: both its reduced transport/gap payload and its
   full transport/gap factor are now shown to agree directly with the proofs
   rebuilt from that route's own lower transport/gap ingredients.
9. `VacuumGapConcreteTwoSeamManuscriptProjection`
   pushes that joint two-seam synthesis back up to the manuscript-facing Part D
   and Route 1 theorem-content surfaces, so the current paper-level QE3 theorem
   API explicitly recovers the same paired reduced payload.
10. `VacuumGapConcreteTwoSeamFanoutProjection`
   fans that joint two-seam synthesis back out into the density / graph-core
   and continuum-transport manuscript-facing sub-seams directly, and then
   combines it with the chosen-site bridge to recover the OS time-upgrade seam
   as well. It also exposes the corresponding closed-manuscript theorem
   surface saying that the chosen-site bridge together with the Route 1
   endpoint package recovers those sub-seams directly. It now also exposes the
   bundled primary QE3 core directly on the Route 1 theorem-content surface,
   together with the statement-level exactness law identifying that bundled
   primary core with the joint first-plus-second seam synthesis, and now also
   pushes that same bundled primary core back to the Part D and shared QE3
   side-condition surfaces, with matching exactness laws there as well. The
   live theorem-level recoveries of that full primary core from Route 1
   theorem content, Part D, and shared side conditions are now also shown to
   agree directly with the proofs rebuilt from that same public two-seam
   synthesis surface. It now also
   exposes the bundled reduced primary QE3 core directly on that same Route 1
   surface, again with an exact statement-level identification with the joint
   first-plus-second seam synthesis, and also pushes that reduced primary core
   back to the Part D and shared QE3 side-condition surfaces, with matching
   exactness laws there as well. The live theorem-level recoveries of that
   reduced primary core from Route 1 theorem content, Part D, and shared side
   conditions are now also shown to agree directly with the proofs rebuilt
   from that same public two-seam synthesis surface. The file now also
   isolates the single genuinely extra OS-side ingredient beyond the two-seam
   synthesis itself: lattice-gap input. It now also records the exact current
   OS-side completion law: the full three-sub-seam package is logically
   equivalent to the joint first-plus-second seam synthesis together with that
   single extra ingredient. It also records the more manuscript-shaped exact
   form of the same statement: the full three-sub-seam package is equivalent
   to the pair of primary sub-seams together with that one extra ingredient,
   and now exposes that extra ingredient directly on the Route 1 theorem-
   content, Part D, and QE3 side-condition surfaces as well. On the closed
   Route 1 theorem-content surface, it now also collapses that extra
   ingredient all the way to plain OS transport readiness, so the full
   three-sub-seam package can be read exactly as the primary QE3 core plus OS
   transport, and equivalently as the joint first-plus-second seam synthesis
   plus OS transport. The live theorem-level recoveries of the isolated OS
   extra ingredient from Route 1 theorem content, Part D, and shared side
   conditions are now also shown to agree directly with the proofs rebuilt
   from plain OS transport readiness itself. The live theorem-level recoveries
   of that full
   three-sub-seam package from Route 1 theorem content, Part D, and shared
   side conditions are now also shown to agree directly with the proofs
   rebuilt from that same manuscript-shaped primary-core-plus-transport
   presentation. It now also exports that full three-sub-seam QE3
   package directly from the Route 1 theorem-content surface, from Part D,
   and from the shared QE3 side-condition package, with matching exactness
   laws on the Part D and shared side-condition surfaces as well. It now also
   records the same closure law in reduced-primary-core form: on those same
   manuscript-facing surfaces, the full three-sub-seam package is exactly the
   bundled reduced primary QE3 core together with plain OS transport
   readiness, and the live theorem-level recoveries from Route 1 theorem
   content, Part D, and shared side conditions are now also shown to agree
   directly both with the proofs rebuilt from the two-seam-plus-transport
   decomposition and with the proofs rebuilt from that smaller
   reduced-primary-plus-transport decomposition. The isolated OS-side extra
   ingredient itself now also
   collapses to plain OS transport readiness on the Part D and shared
   side-condition surfaces, not only on Route 1 theorem content.
11. `VacuumGapConcreteOSTimeUpgradeProjection`
   isolates the dyadic-to-continuous-time OS seam on the manuscript-facing
   Route 1 surface and proves that, at the current theorem level, it is
   exactly equivalent to the reduced payload consisting of OS transport
   readiness, lattice-gap input, and transport origin. It now also exports
   both that seam and its reduced payload on the Part D and shared
   side-condition surfaces, with matching seam/reduced exactness laws there
   as well. The live theorem-level seam recoveries on the closed manuscript,
   Part D, and shared side-condition surfaces are now also shown to agree
   directly with the proofs rebuilt from those same reduced OS payloads.
12. `VacuumGapConcreteOSProofHomeProjection`
   connects the manuscript-facing OS time-upgrade seam back to the native
   proof-home and chosen-site bridge layers, showing that both already carry
   its reduced payload and hence the full seam. It now also records explicitly
   that, at the current theorem surface, the reduced payload and full seam
   recovered from those two source layers are exact source-level equivalents
   of the manuscript-facing OS seam surfaces. It now also records directly
   that those two source routes agree exactly with one another at both the
   reduced-payload and full-seam levels, and that the corresponding reduced-
   payload and full-seam source recoveries now agree by direct proof equality
   as well. Each source route's recovery of the full OS time-upgrade seam is
   now also shown to agree directly with the proof rebuilt from that same
   source route's own reduced OS payload. The reduced OS payload recoveries
   themselves are now likewise shown to agree directly with the proofs rebuilt
   from their own lower OS ingredients on both source routes.
13. `VacuumGapConcreteContinuumTransportProjection`
   isolates the continuum transport plus sharp-local gap seam on the
   manuscript-facing Route 1 surface and proves that, at the current theorem
   level, it is exactly equivalent to the reduced payload consisting of
   positive gap, Minkowski-gap readiness, and transport origin. It now also
   exports that reduced payload directly from the Route 1 theorem-content
   surface itself, and now also exports the seam itself on the Part D and
   shared side-condition surfaces, with matching seam/reduced exactness laws
   there as well. The live theorem-level seam recoveries on the closed
   manuscript, Part D, and shared side-condition surfaces are now also shown
   to agree directly with the proofs rebuilt from those same reduced
   continuum-transport payloads.
14. `VacuumGapConcreteContinuumTransportProofHomeProjection`
   connects the manuscript-facing continuum transport seam back to the
   mass-gap chain and the Route 1 endpoint native package, showing that both
   already carry its reduced payload and hence the full seam. It now also
   records explicitly that, at the current theorem surface, the reduced
   payload and full seam recovered from those two source layers are exact
   source-level equivalents of the manuscript-facing continuum-transport seam
   surfaces. It now also records directly that those two source routes agree
   exactly with one another at both the reduced-payload and full-seam levels,
   and that the corresponding reduced-payload and full-seam source recoveries
   now agree by direct proof equality as well. Each source route's recovery of
   the full continuum-transport seam is now also shown to agree directly with
   the proof rebuilt from that same source route's own reduced transport/gap
   payload.
15. `VacuumGapConcreteDensityGraphProjection`
   isolates the density plus graph-core seam on the manuscript-facing Route 1
   surface and proves that, at the current theorem level, it is exactly
   equivalent to the reduced payload consisting of positive gap, OS-sector
   readiness, and transport origin. It now also exports that reduced payload
   directly from the Route 1 theorem-content surface itself, and now also
   exports the seam itself on the Part D and shared side-condition surfaces,
   with matching seam/reduced exactness laws there as well. The live
   theorem-level seam recoveries on the closed manuscript, Part D, and shared
   side-condition surfaces are now also shown to agree directly with the
   proofs rebuilt from those same reduced density/graph payloads.
16. `EndpointConcreteUpstreamSideConditions`
   packages concrete upstream route/core witnesses into a reusable endpoint
   side-condition bundle exposing semantic bundles and an exact-endpoint
   witness.
17. `EndpointConcreteProofHomeProjection`
   shows that the kernel endpoint native proof-home layer already carries the
   exact local endpoint witness and the manuscript's `O.5` endpoint-exclusion
   statement directly, and that combining that proof-home endpoint data with
   the already-exported QE3 transport/gap payload recovers both the smaller
   and paper-shaped Route 1 endpoint second seams. It also records explicitly
   that, at the theorem surface currently formalized, those proof-home-derived
   endpoint boundary and second-seam statements are exact source-level
   equivalents of the corresponding statements recovered from the larger Route
   1 endpoint package. Those smaller and paper-shaped proof-home second-seam
   recoveries are now also shown to agree directly with the proofs rebuilt
   from their own transport/gap, endpoint-boundary, and `O.5` source
   ingredients. They are now also shown to agree by direct proof equality with
   the corresponding smaller and paper-shaped second-seam recoveries from the
   larger Route 1 endpoint package itself. The underlying exact-endpoint
   witness, explicit `O.5` exclusion statement, and smaller endpoint-boundary
   statement recovered from the proof-home route are now likewise shown to
   agree by direct proof equality with the corresponding recoveries from that
   larger Route 1 endpoint package.
18. `EndpointTheoremScopeObjects`
   formalizes manuscript-side theorem-scope objects, local shadows, support
   equivalence, deformation data, and abstract sector realizations.
19. `EndpointConcreteTheoremScopeBridge`
   attaches those objects to the existing Companion III reconstructed-sector
   carrier.
20. `EndpointGlobalFormRecoveryFormalization`
   packages the Section 7 distinction surface and the concrete Companion III
   global-form recovery theorem.
21. `EndpointTaggedTheoremScopeRealization`
   sharpens the Companion III realization by retaining theorem-scope
   global-form data inside the realized object.
22. `EndpointCompletionBridgeFormalization`
   formalizes the Section 8 bridge from sector realizations to scope-faithful
   admissible completions.
23. `EndpointClayConclusionFormalization`
   packages the Clay-facing endpoint surface and the concrete distinction plus
   endpoint inheritance theorems for both the coarse and tagged Companion III
   routes.
24. `EndpointTaggedManuscriptCorollaries`
   exposes the tagged route as the preferred manuscript-facing corollary layer
   for Section 7 distinction and Section 8 endpoint inheritance.
25. `EndpointConcretePreferredRouteCompatibility`
    adds an explicit theorem-level compatibility package saying how a concrete
    upstream Yang--Mills witness bundle feeds the preferred tagged endpoint
    conclusion, together with direct convenience theorems that recover the
    preferred Section 8 and combined Section 7 plus Section 8 conclusions from
    a plain endpoint admissibility fact, names the remaining Section 8
    paper-bridge shapes explicitly, aligns the remaining abstract target with
    the patched manuscript theorem "Route 1 endpoint second seam forces the
    admissibility side conditions", routes the closed-manuscript endpoint
    bridge through the sharper concrete Route 1 second-seam object, and now
    also exposes both a named statement object for that patched theorem and a
    direct route from the canonical closed-manuscript paper-flow theorem into
    the preferred Section 8 endpoint conclusion. It now also provides a
    structured extension-side proof object for that patched theorem, built from
    the canonical paper-second seam together with the named Section 8 theorem
    statement, and constructors showing how the older closed-manuscript
    boundary bridge induces that structured object both directly and through
    the canonical paper-flow seam. It also records that, in the current theorem
    surface, the paper-shaped second seam still reduces to the smaller Route 1
    second seam at the point where the endpoint admissibility conclusion is
    consumed, and the endpoint-proof-home realization of that paper-shaped
    feed now lands in the same patched Section 8 equivalence class as the
    closed-manuscript paper-shaped feed. The smaller proof-home Section 8 feed
    now also collapses directly to both the patched theorem statement and the
    older closed-manuscript boundary bridge. The file now also isolates an
    even sharper remaining theorem target:
    building the structured patched-theorem bridge object directly from the
    Route 1 paper-second seam itself. That sharper target is now also recorded
    as logically equivalent to the patched Section 8 theorem statement: it does
    not add new mathematical content, but packages the same seam as a first-
    class bridge object rather than only as an endpoint implication. It now
    also exposes a manuscript-shaped Section 8 assumption bundle mirroring the
    patched proof strategy; in that bundle, the scope-faithful-extension and
    admissible-completion clauses are shown to be automatic from the completion
    bridge, leaving the Route 1 second-seam to admissibility implication as the
    only genuinely new field. That bundle is now also integrated into the
    existing endpoint route by constructors from the older closed-manuscript
    boundary bridge, with endpoint conclusions recovered from the bundle
    directly, and with the combined preferred Section 7 plus Section 8
    corollaries exposed from the same bundle surface. The compatibility layer
    now also isolates the most paper-faithful formulation of the remaining
    Section 8 target: building that full patched assumption bundle directly
    from the Route 1 paper-second seam, and records that this target is
    logically equivalent to the patched theorem statement itself. So the file
    now exposes three explicitly equivalent Section 8 views: the patched
    theorem statement, the structured bridge object, and the full manuscript-
    shaped assumption bundle. It now also makes that most paper-faithful
    target directly usable for both the Section 8 endpoint conclusion and the
    combined preferred Section 7 plus Section 8 corollary, including the
    boundary-bridge-induced and canonical paper-flow variants of the same
    route, with matching boundary-bridge routes now exposed for both the
    endpoint-only and combined Section 7 plus Section 8 conclusions. It now
    also isolates the single genuinely non-automatic endpoint-side extra
    ingredient beyond the completion bridge itself: the Route 1 paper-second
    seam to admissibility implication, together with direct endpoint and
    combined Section 7 plus Section 8 routes from that ingredient and a
    boundary-bridge constructor showing where the current implementation still
    obtains it. The same extra-ingredient surface is now tied back directly to
    both the manuscript-shaped patched assumption bundle and the most
    paper-faithful bundle-building target, so the endpoint seam hierarchy is
    explicit all the way down. On the closed manuscript, that extra ingredient
    now also collapses to the smaller Route 1 second-seam feed itself, because
    the explicit `O.5` theorem content is canonical once the Route 1 endpoint
    package is fixed. On the closed manuscript, the older boundary
    bridge is now also part of that same exact equivalence class: it is shown
    equivalent not only to the isolated extra ingredient, but also to the
    patched theorem statement, the patched assumption bundle, the most
    paper-faithful bundle-building target, the structured bridge target, and
    now directly to the smaller Route 1 endpoint second-seam feed itself. The
    patched theorem statement and the most paper-faithful bundle-building
    target now also collapse directly to that same smallest second-seam feed.
    The compatibility layer now also packages the older boundary bridge
    directly into that smallest second-seam compatibility surface and exposes
    the preferred Section 8 and combined Section 7 plus Section 8 routes from
    that minimal package as well. It now also lets the endpoint native
    proof-home source route feed the same smallest second-seam interface
    directly, so the preferred Section 8 and combined Section 7 plus Section 8
    conclusions can be recovered not only from the larger Route 1 endpoint
    package, but also from the endpoint proof-home layer together with the
    already exported QE3 transport/gap payload. The same proof-home source
    route now also feeds the sharper paper-shaped second-seam interface
    directly, with matching endpoint and combined Section 7 plus Section 8
    compatibility routes there as well. It now also names a Section 8 feed
    directly on the endpoint-proof-home realization of the smallest second
    seam and records that, at the current theorem surface, this proof-home
    feed is exactly equivalent to the existing smallest closed-manuscript
    second-seam feed. It now also does the same at the sharper paper-shaped
    second-seam level, and that sharper proof-home feed now also collapses to
    the older closed-manuscript boundary bridge, so both the smaller and
    paper-shaped Section 8 feeds are source-grounded explicitly back to the
    endpoint proof-home layer. Both proof-home feed levels now also land
    directly on the patched assumption-bundle, structured-bridge, and
    paper-faithful bundle-building surfaces. At the concrete compatibility-
    wrapper level, the proof-home second-seam packages are now also recorded
    as exactly equal to the corresponding closed-manuscript second-seam
    compatibility packages themselves. When those proof-home feeds are
    themselves induced from the older closed-manuscript boundary bridge, the
    resulting proof-home compatibility wrappers now also agree exactly with
    the corresponding boundary-bridge-induced compatibility wrappers. The
    sharper proof-home paper-feed is now also recorded as collapsing directly
    to the smaller proof-home feed itself, and the resulting two proof-home
    compatibility wrappers are shown to agree exactly as well. When both
    proof-home feeds are induced from that same older boundary bridge, the
    resulting two proof-home boundary-bridge compatibility wrappers are now
    also shown to agree exactly with each other directly. The corresponding
    proof-home boundary-bridge routes are now also exposed directly at the
    preferred Section 8 theorem level and at the combined preferred Section 7
    plus Section 8 corollary level, for both the smaller and the paper-shaped
    proof-home feed variants. Those live theorem-level proof-home
    boundary-bridge routes are now also shown to agree exactly with the
    corresponding closed-manuscript theorem-level routes themselves.
    The same proof-home boundary-bridge route is now also pushed one layer
    higher into the main Section 8 proof-object hierarchy: it now induces the
    patched assumption bundle, the paper-faithful bundle-building target, and
    the structured bridge target directly, and those proof-home constructions
    are shown to agree exactly with the corresponding closed-manuscript
    boundary-bridge constructions, both at the smaller and paper-shaped
    proof-home levels. At that same paper-faithful theorem layer, the two
    proof-home theorem routes are now also recorded as agreeing directly with
    one another, not only separately with the corresponding closed-manuscript
    routes.
26. `VacuumGapConcretePrimaryCoreProofHomeProjection`
    records that the two actual upstream source pairs carrying the primary QE3
    core already recover the bundled primary closure surfaces directly: native
    proof homes together with the mass-gap chain, and chosen-site bridge
    together with the Route 1 endpoint package, each recover both the bundled
    reduced primary QE3 core and the bundled full primary QE3 core, and hence
    the live two-seam synthesis theorem surface itself. It now also records
    directly that those two actual upstream source routes agree exactly with
    one another at the live two-seam synthesis level as well as at both the
    reduced-primary-core and full-primary-core levels. Those same agreements
    are now also exposed as direct proof equalities of the recovered
    source-route theorems themselves at all three bundled levels, and the two
    primary-core source recoveries are now also shown to agree directly with
    the proofs rebuilt from their own internal live two-seam synthesis. The
    live two-seam source recoveries themselves are now also shown to agree
    directly with the proofs rebuilt from their own two isolated reduced seam
    recoveries, not only with the larger bundled primary-core packages.
27. `VacuumGapConcreteFullCoreProofHomeProjection`
    pushes that source-layer grounding one step further by recording that the
    same two actual upstream source triples already recover the full QE3
    three-sub-seam closure package itself: native proof homes together with
    the mass-gap chain, and chosen-site bridge together with the Route 1
    endpoint package, now each recover the full bundled QE3 closure surface.
    It now also records directly that those two source routes agree exactly
    with one another at that full three-sub-seam level, and that within each
    source route individually the full three-sub-seam package collapses
    exactly to the bundled primary QE3 core together with that same source
    route's single OS-side extra ingredient. It now also records the sharper
    internal collapse from that same full source-triple package all the way
    down to the live two-seam synthesis together with that same source route's
    single OS-side extra ingredient. It now also records the still smaller
    internal collapse from that same full source-triple package down to the
    reduced primary QE3 core together with that same source route's single
   OS-side extra ingredient, and the resulting full-source recoveries are
   shown to agree directly with the proofs rebuilt from that reduced-primary-
   plus-OS decomposition as well. The OS-side extra ingredient itself is
   now also named and synchronized at the source-route level: each full
   source route is shown to recover exactly the same single OS-side
   ingredient as appears on the Route 1 / Part D / side-condition surfaces,
   and the two source routes are shown to agree with one another directly at
   that extra-ingredient level too. That isolated OS-side extra ingredient is
   now also shown to agree by direct proof equality across the two source
   routes, not only by source-route exactness, and it now also collapses
   directly to plain OS transport readiness on each source route, with
   matching proof equalities there as well. The full bundled three-sub-seam
   source recoveries are now also shown to agree by direct proof equality, not
   only by source-route exactness.
28. `VacuumGapConcreteClosureProofHomeProjection`
    lifts those same source-pair recoveries one step further up the QE3
    closure ladder: the native-proof-home/mass-gap-chain pair and the chosen-
    site-bridge/Route-1-endpoint-package pair now each recover the QE3
    minimal payload and the full QE3 critical seam directly, with matching
    exactness laws now exposed not only on the Route 1 surface but also on
    the manuscript-facing Part D and shared side-condition surfaces. It now
    also records directly that those two actual upstream source routes agree
    exactly with one another at both the minimal-payload and critical-seam
    levels. It now also records the sharper internal collapse that, within
    each higher closure source route individually, both the QE3 critical seam
    and even the QE3 minimal payload reduce exactly to that same route's live
    two-seam synthesis together with its single OS-side extra ingredient. The
    resulting minimal-payload and critical-seam source recoveries are now also
    shown to agree by direct proof equality, and to agree directly with the
    proofs rebuilt from that smaller internal two-seam-plus-OS decomposition
    itself. It now also records the same sharper collapse one layer lower:
    both higher closure source routes already reduce exactly to that same
    route's reduced primary QE3 core together with its single OS-side extra
    ingredient, and the resulting higher source recoveries are shown to agree
    directly with the proofs rebuilt from that reduced-primary-plus-OS
    decomposition as well.

This is deliberately trivial at term level; the substance lives in the imported
