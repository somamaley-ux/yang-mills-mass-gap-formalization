# Yang--Mills Extension Stack

This folder contains the Lean-facing extension stack for the nonlocal
Yang--Mills endpoint paper.

## Main point

The main human-facing result here is the analytical mechanization of four
critical seams:

- the QE3 density / graph-core handoff
- the dyadic-to-continuous-time OS upgrade
- the continuum transport / sharp-gap bridge
- the Section 8 endpoint / admissibility bridge

These are the main transitions that used to be easiest to describe only at a
high level. In the current stack they are isolated as named theorem surfaces,
reduced payloads, proof-home projections, source-route recoveries, and direct
reconstruction paths.

## Manuscript shape

The stack is organized in manuscript-facing terms:

- `EndpointTheoremScopeObjects.lean` fixes the theorem-scope support/label
  object layer and now names the preferred paper-facing theorem-scope class.
  It also names a canonical Section 4 theorem-scope package for the current
  extension stack.
- `EndpointConcreteTheoremScopeBridge.lean` realizes that layer in the existing
  reconstructed-sector carrier at the baseline infrastructure level.
- `EndpointGlobalFormRecoveryFormalization.lean` packages the Section 7
  same-local-shadow / different-global-form recovery surface.
- `EndpointTaggedTheoremScopeRealization.lean` upgrades that bridge to the
  canonical current paper-facing tagged realization route and now names the
  canonical Section 4 bridge surfaces explicitly.
- `EndpointCompletionBridgeFormalization.lean`,
  `EndpointClayConclusionFormalization.lean`, and
  `EndpointConcretePreferredRouteCompatibility.lean` carry the Section 8
  completion/admissibility bridge. The completion and Clay-endpoint layers now
  also speak directly in terms of the canonical packaged theorem-scope object,
  not only in raw theorem-scope parameters. The compatibility layer now also
  names one canonical manuscript-facing Section 8 theorem surface and one
  canonical combined Section 7 plus Section 8 corollary.

On the QE3 side, the main seam files are:

- `VacuumGapConcreteCriticalSeam.lean`
- `VacuumGapConcreteOSTimeUpgradeProjection.lean`
- `VacuumGapConcreteContinuumTransportProjection.lean`

## Section map

If you are reading the extension manuscript by section number, the quickest file
map is:

- Section 4: `EndpointTheoremScopeObjects.lean` and
  `EndpointConcreteTheoremScopeBridge.lean`
- Section 7: `EndpointGlobalFormRecoveryFormalization.lean` and
  `EndpointTaggedManuscriptCorollaries.lean`
- Section 8: `EndpointCompletionBridgeFormalization.lean`,
  `EndpointClayConclusionFormalization.lean`, and
  `EndpointConcretePreferredRouteCompatibility.lean`

The four seam files cut across that section structure:

- QE3 density / graph-core handoff:
  `VacuumGapConcreteCriticalSeam.lean`
- dyadic-to-continuous-time OS upgrade:
  `VacuumGapConcreteOSTimeUpgradeProjection.lean`
- continuum transport / sharp-gap bridge:
  `VacuumGapConcreteContinuumTransportProjection.lean`
- Section 8 endpoint / admissibility bridge:
  `EndpointConcretePreferredRouteCompatibility.lean`

## Suggested reading order

If you want the shortest route through the extension story, read:

1. `EndpointFormalizationOverview.lean`
2. `VacuumGapConcreteCriticalSeam.lean`
3. `VacuumGapConcreteOSTimeUpgradeProjection.lean`
4. `VacuumGapConcreteContinuumTransportProjection.lean`
5. `EndpointConcreteTheoremScopeBridge.lean`
6. `EndpointGlobalFormRecoveryFormalization.lean`
7. `EndpointConcretePreferredRouteCompatibility.lean`

## Residuals

The remaining abstraction is now relatively narrow:

- the most paper-faithful concrete instantiation of the theorem-scope
  extended-support class is now canonically named in code, but still wants its
  most paper-faithful final manuscript wording
- the final Section 8 residual is now narrower than before: the canonical
  packaged endpoint surfaces exist, and the canonical manuscript-facing Section
  8 theorem is now named, but the compatibility layer still presents several
  equivalent patched theorem / bundle / bridge formulations that need to be
  further demoted behind that preferred route
