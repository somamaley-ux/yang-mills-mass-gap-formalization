# Yang-Mills Closed Manuscript Instantiation Draft

Last updated: 2026-04-09

This note records the manuscript-level closed-instance assignments you supplied
for the final Lean target:

- `I : YMClosedInstantiatedManuscript`

It is intended as the concrete draft companion to:

- [ClosedManuscriptAuthorWorksheet.md](/d:/lean/MaleyLean/MaleyLean/Papers/YangMills/ClosedManuscriptAuthorWorksheet.md)
- [ClosedInstantiatedManuscript.lean](/d:/lean/MaleyLean/MaleyLean/Papers/YangMills/Kernel/ClosedInstantiatedManuscript.lean)

## Final Lean Target

We will construct:

- `I : YMClosedInstantiatedManuscript`

with:

- `blueprint : YMClosedManuscriptBlueprint`
- `chosen_sites : YMChosenSiteBlueprint blueprint`

## A. Global Spine Object

Concrete manuscript object:

- `S` is the ten-packet public proof spine defined in the core paper.
- It consists of:
  - Packet 1 through Packet 10 theorem objects
  - the auxiliary weak-window certificate
  - the three route interfaces: constructive, vacuum-gap, endpoint

Packet assignments:

- Packet 1: compact-simple A1 ultraviolet theorem `(III.1)` plus public
  group-scope export `(III.2)`
- Packet 2: one-shot entrance `(III.3)`
- Packet 3: tuned fixed-lattice gap `(IV.1)`
- Packet 4: flowed continuum state `(4.92-4.95)`
- Packet 5: exact-dimension plus finite truncation package
  `(L.8, L.11, 5.39, 5.69, F.245)`
- Packet 6: mixed correlator plus finite-cap bridge package
  `(F.330A, F.331, 5.74A-5.76)`

  `(III.18, F.211-F.216, F.5)`
- Packet 9: Euclidean plus reconstruction packet `(M.1-M.6)`
- Packet 10: universality plus local-net endpoint `(O.2-O.7)`
- Auxiliary weak-window certificate: `F.298`

Theorem-part props:

## Honest Stop Condition

Under this draft, the intended next formal step is to define:

- `I : YMClosedInstantiatedManuscript`

and thereby inhabit:

- `ym_closed_manuscript_completion`

from [ClosedManuscriptCompletionCriterion.lean](/d:/lean/MaleyLean/MaleyLean/Papers/YangMills/Kernel/ClosedManuscriptCompletionCriterion.lean).
