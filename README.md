# Yang--Mills Full Native Package Boundary

Standalone Lean snapshot for the Yang--Mills slice of the wider `MaleyLean`
project, aligned with the current manuscript-facing native package boundary.

## Start here

If you are new to this repository, the naming split is:

- `MaleyLean` is the Lean package name
- `YangMills` is the paper/topic packaged in this standalone export

The main entry points are:

- `Main.lean`
  the single canonical standalone entry point; it loads
  `MaleyLean.YangMillsFullManuscriptNativePackage`
- `BundleMain.lean`
  optional broader bundle that loads the full native package and its summary
  surface together

If you want one file to inspect first, start with `Main.lean`.

## Contents

- `MaleyLean/`
  standalone Lean dependency closure for the current Yang--Mills manuscript
  package boundary
- `Checks/Axiom/YangMillsFullManuscriptNativePackageAxiomCheck.lean`
  dedicated top-package axiom audit entry point
- `paper/`
  bundled manuscript source tree, source archive, and supplied PDFs
- `reports/audits/yang_mills_submission_layer_audit_2026-04-15.md`
  referee-facing audit note for the current top package boundary
- `reports/support_maps/yang_mills_support_map.txt`
  manuscript-to-Lean support map
- `reports/status/yang_mills_status.md`
  human-readable status note
- `reports/submission/`
  editor/referee-facing submission support notes

## Build

This project uses Lean `v4.28.0` via `lean-toolchain`.

Build the extracted project with:

```text
lake build
```

Build the single canonical paper entry point with:

```text
lake env lean Main.lean
```

Run the dedicated top-package axiom check with:

```text
lake env lean Checks\\Axiom\\YangMillsFullManuscriptNativePackageAxiomCheck.lean
```

## Scope

This repo packages the current strongest manuscript-facing Yang--Mills native
boundary available in the source development: the constructive, vacuum-gap, and
endpoint theorem-object, proof-home, law-atom, primitive, certificate, trace,
and construction-stage layers tied together in
`YangMillsFullManuscriptNativePackageExportStatement`.

It also bundles the current manuscript tree rooted in `core.tex`,
`companion1.tex`, `companion2.tex`, and `companion3.tex`, together with the
anonymized source archive, anonymized companion PDFs, and the proof-kernel
extraction materials.

This repository should be read as a strong manuscript-facing formal companion to
the current Yang--Mills submission boundary. It is not yet a claim that every
underlying analytic Yang--Mills argument has already been fully internalized as
foundational Lean analysis.
