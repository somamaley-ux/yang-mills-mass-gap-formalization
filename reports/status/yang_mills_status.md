# Yang--Mills Lean Status

## Current state

The Yang--Mills project in this repository is now in a strong
manuscript-facing structural state.

What is finished:

- the live proof surface is encoded in Lean
- the core theorem titles are encoded
- the companion ownership map is encoded
- the live dependency spine is encoded
- the proof-kernel extraction is encoded
- the ten-packet reduction is encoded
- the decisive seam nodes are encoded
- the source-label crosswalk back to the canonical manuscript is encoded
- the load-bearing proof spine is encoded
- dedicated Part C, Part D, and endpoint cores are encoded
- named abstract witness outputs are exposed across all three theorem hearts
- the stronger Part C finite-cap and sharp-local witnesses are crosswalked separately too
- the endpoint reconstruction and exact-endpoint witnesses are crosswalked separately too
- those named witnesses are crosswalked back to packet ownership and source labels
- the stronger Part D transport-side witnesses are crosswalked separately too
- the three theorem-heart exports are also packaged as a structured witness bundle object
- the three theorem-heart witness bundles are also summarized together in one additive Lean surface theorem
- that witness bundle is now exported again at manuscript-facing surface level
- the three theorem-heart semantic bundles are assembled into one unified semantic object and re-exported at surface level
- the top-level manuscript-facing summary is axiom-free
- a closed manuscript instantiation constant is present
- the closed manuscript completion criterion is realized
- the Lane A heart is packaged as native theorem objects
- the Route 1 mass-gap heart is packaged as native theorem objects and chosen-site compatibility objects
- the endpoint heart is packaged as native theorem objects
- the `M.5 -> O.2 / O.3 / O.5` bridge is packaged as one native theorem object
- the strongest current submission-facing boundary is one full native manuscript package

What is not finished:

- a full end-to-end Lean formalization of the underlying Yang--Mills QFT/PDE
  mathematics
- discharge in Lean of the analytic arguments cited by the manuscript proof
  homes
- replacement of the companion/source proofs with native Lean proofs

## What the formalization says

The current Lean development supports the following reading.

- The hardened Yang--Mills archive has a four-root live proof surface.
- `proofkernel.tex` is an expert-audit extraction, not a second source of new
  mathematics.
- The public theorem burden is organized by ten packets plus one auxiliary
  weak-window certificate.
- The decisive expert-attack seams are explicit rather than hidden in prose.
- The cleaned public theorem nodes are crosswalked back to canonical source
  labels such as `F.331`, `5.74`, `F.216`, `M.3`, and `O.5`.
- The load-bearing theorem object is split into dedicated constructive,
  vacuum-gap, and endpoint cores rather than treated as one opaque packet list.
- Those dedicated cores now expose named abstract witnesses such as finite-cap
  bridge readiness, bounded-base extension, positive gap, Minkowski-gap
  readiness, Wightman fields, and the exact endpoint object.
- The richer Part C package is now also tracked at the witness level via
  explicit finite-cap window, bridge, compatibility, and bounded-base
  extension crosswalk entries.
- The endpoint package is now also tracked at the witness level via explicit
  reconstruction-readiness, Wightman-field, vacuum-vector, and exact-endpoint
  crosswalk entries.
- Those witnesses are now explicitly assigned to primary packets, companion
  owners, and canonical source labels.
- The three theorem-heart witness bundles are now also collected in one
  additive summary theorem, so the manuscript-facing surface can talk about
  the constructive, vacuum-gap, and endpoint anchors together.
- The same three-heart exports are now also exposed as a structured witness
  bundle object and then re-exported at surface level, so later semantic
  deepening can target one bundle interface instead of many parallel facts.
- The three theorem hearts are now also assembled at the semantic-bundle level
  into one unified typed object, and that object is re-exported at surface
  level under explicit readiness hypotheses.
- The richer Part D package is now also tracked at the witness level via
  explicit OS-transport and transport-origin crosswalk entries.
- The manuscript object package also now defines a concrete
  `YMClosedInstantiatedManuscript` and proves
  `ym_closed_manuscript_completion`.
- The strongest current referee-facing theorem boundary is now
  `YangMillsFullManuscriptNativePackageExportStatement`, which exposes public
  scope, Part C, Part D, endpoint, key theorem labels, and key witness labels
  together in one axiom-free theorem.

## Why this matters

This makes the Yang--Mills manuscript much easier to interrogate honestly.
The Lean surface now says:

- what counts as live proof burden,
- what is only audit extraction,
- what is only closure packaging,
- what remains reserve support material,
- and how the public theorem surface maps back to the source manuscript.

That does not prove the Yang--Mills mathematics in Lean, but it does remove a
large amount of ambiguity about manuscript structure, dependency order, and
seam locality.

## Main verification artifacts

The most relevant axiom checks are:

- `YangMillsVerbatimTheoremRegisterAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsClaimLedgerAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsKernelRegisterAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsPacketRegisterAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsSeamRegisterAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsConstructiveCoreAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsVacuumGapCoreAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsEndpointCoreAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsNamedOutputsAssemblyAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsSourceCrosswalkAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsConstructiveWitnessCrosswalkAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsEndpointWitnessCrosswalkAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsWitnessCrosswalkAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsVacuumGapWitnessCrosswalkAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsWitnessBundleAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsSemanticAssemblyAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsSemanticAssemblySummaryAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsWitnessBundleSummaryAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsWitnessHeartSummaryAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsPaperSurfaceSummaryAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsConstructiveTheoremObjectsAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsVacuumGapTheoremObjectsAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsVacuumGapMassGapChainAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsVacuumGapMassGapCompatibilityAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsVacuumGapChosenSiteBridgeObjectsAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsEndpointTheoremObjectsAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsVacuumGapEndpointBridgeObjectsAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsRoute1EndpointNativePackageAxiomCheck.lean`
- `YangMillsFullManuscriptNativePackageAxiomCheck.lean`

These checks report the current manuscript-facing Yang--Mills surface as
axiom-free.

The strongest current theorem-level audit result is that
`YangMillsFullManuscriptNativePackageExportStatement` is axiom-free.

## Best next directions

If this project is pushed further, the highest-value directions are:

1. add a subsection and reading-order register mirroring the kernel attack
   guidance
2. extend the source crosswalk to more of the companion-local theorem tables
3. write theorem-by-theorem support maps or audits parallel to the existing
   Navier--Stokes reporting style
4. keep deepening the dedicated theorem-heart cores so more of the manuscript's
   mathematical exports live in structured witness packages instead of flat
   route propositions
