# Yang--Mills Solution Dossier Note

Last updated: 2026-04-19

## Purpose

This note records the strongest careful human-facing claim the current
Yang--Mills Lean package supports.

It is meant for readers asking a higher-standard question than "is there a lot
of formalization here?" The question addressed here is:

"How close is this repository to a genuinely deep solution-grade dossier, and
what is still only polish rather than closure?"

## Current dossier-level answer

The current repository looks strong enough to support a deep dossier claim at
the manuscript-facing and decisive-seam levels.

That claim rests on four facts:

- the live manuscript theorem families are encoded and crosswalked back to
  source ownership
- the decisive theorem-heart exports are packaged in axiom-free Lean surfaces
- the four highest-risk analytic seams are mechanized explicitly rather than
  left as broad route slogans
- the extension paper now has canonical Section 4 and Section 8 theorem
  surfaces, with several visible alternate Section 8 routes collapsed back onto
  the canonical endpoint theorem

So the current package no longer reads like a loose archive of theorem names or
an aspirational proof scaffold. It reads like a manuscript-facing solution
dossier whose hard transitions have been isolated, named, reconstructed, and
checked.

## What this dossier claim does mean

At the current boundary, the repo supports the following strong reading.

- The Yang--Mills development is structurally complete relative to its encoded
  manuscript inventory.
- The decisive seam logic is visible at local theorem level, not only at the
  summary-export level.
- The extension paper's central analytic burden is no longer hidden in prose.
- The current public theorem boundary is organized as an axiom-free Lean
  package with explicit witness, crosswalk, and source-route control.

This is already enough to treat the project as a serious referee-facing
solution dossier rather than a generic formalization-in-progress note.

## What this dossier claim does not mean

This note still does not claim:

- a full first-principles Lean derivation of every cited Yang--Mills analytic
  proof home
- replacement of all imported manuscript proof homes with native foundational
  QFT/PDE analysis
- immunity from further presentation cleanup or manuscript-faithfulness
  tightening

Those are real distinctions, and they matter if the target standard is a
Millennium-level final package.

## Remaining work at this standard

The remaining work now looks narrower than the phrase "finish the extension
paper" might suggest.

- The theorem-scope class wants one last manuscript-faithful wording pass so
  the final Section 4 presentation matches the canonical Lean object as tightly
  as possible.
- A few Section 8 support routes still want one last demotion pass so they read
  unmistakably as provenance and exactness wrappers around the canonical
  theorem.
- The final human-facing dossier could still be tightened so a skeptical reader
  sees immediately what is closed, what is proof-home dependent, and what is
  only presentational residue.

These are no longer the same kind of tasks as mechanizing the four critical
seams. They are closure-discipline tasks around a package whose main analytic
spine is already substantially in place.

## Best current claim discipline

The strongest careful statement right now is:

"The current Yang--Mills repository supports a deep manuscript-facing
solution-dossier claim. The decisive seams are mechanized, the main theorem
surfaces are canonically fixed, and the remaining work is concentrated in final
presentation discipline rather than unresolved analytic closure at the critical
seams."
